# ADR 4: Permissions Management

## Decision

We will implement a permission request mechanism for location services, notifications, and other essential device features during the initial app launch. Clear and informative explanations will accompany each request.

## Rationale

User transparency and trust are paramount. Justifying the necessity of requested permissions builds confidence and understanding among users.

## Status

Decision proposed.

## Consequences

- Enhanced user trust and confidence
- Accurate service delivery based on granted permissions
- Potential user hesitation if justification for permissions is unclear.
