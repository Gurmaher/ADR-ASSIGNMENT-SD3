# ADR 1: Choice of Mobile App Type

## Decision

We have chosen to develop a native app for both Android and iOS platforms, using Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS.

## Rationale

Opting for native app development harnesses the strengths of each platform. Kotlin and Swift are the preferred languages for Android and iOS, respectively, offering superior performance and seamless integration with device-specific features.

## Status

Decision approved.

## Consequences

- Exceptional user experience
- Optimized performance
- Utilization of platform-specific capabilities
- Increased development effort and timeline due to platform-specific coding.
