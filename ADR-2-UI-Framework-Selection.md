# ADR 2: UI Framework Selection

## Decision

We will employ React Native along with popular UI libraries like Material-UI for Android and UIKit for iOS to ensure a consistent and user-friendly interface on both platforms.

## Rationale

React Native streamlines cross-platform development while Material-UI and UIKit provide platform-specific design consistency, expediting development and enhancing maintainability.

## Status

Decision adopted.

## Consequences

- Uniform and contemporary UI design
- Expedited development cycles through reusable UI components
- Improved ease of long-term maintenance.
